
Project Overview: GlucoBridge

Objective: A mobile-first, responsive web app for blood glucose interpretation and cardiovascular health education.

Core Value: Simplifying complex medical data into actionable, low-literacy-friendly guidance.

1. Visual Identity & Design System

Palette: * Primary: Deep Medical Blue (#1E5EFF)

Secondary: Soft Teal/Cyan accents

Status: Success (Soft Green), Warning (Amber), Error (Muted Red)

Surface: Off-white background with white rounded cards (24px radius) and subtle elevation shadows.

Typography: * Headings: Inter/Poppins Bold (High contrast).

Body: Inter/Roboto Regular (Large line height for readability).

Iconography: Thin-stroke outline icons with rounded terminals (e.g., Lucide or Feather Icons).

2. Redefined Screen Flow

Screen 1: Trust & Onboarding (The Hero)

Visual: Full-height hero card with the GlucoBridge logo.

Copy: "Understand Your Blood Sugar. Take the Next Step."

Value Props: 3 icon-based bullet points (Screening, Guidance, Education).

CTA: Large, full-width "Get Started" button.

Screen 2: Risk Screening (Context Collection)

UI: Stepper component (Step 1 of 3).

Form: Large tap targets.

Horizontal pill selectors for Age and Gender.

Clean toggle switches for Family History and High Blood Pressure.

Multi-select checkbox cards for Symptoms (Fatigue, Thirst, etc.).

Screen 3: Data Entry (The Input)

UI: Stepper (Step 2 of 3).

Toggle: "Enter Manually" vs "Upload Photo" segmented control.

Manual: Numerical input with a clear unit toggle (mg/dL | mmol/L).

Vision: Image upload zone with a dashed border and camera icon.

Screen 4: Interpretation & Integrated Education (The Insight)

Dynamic Banner: Color-coded status (e.g., Orange for "Prediabetes Detected").

Large Value Display: Bold center-aligned glucose number.

The "Health Tips" Section (New): * Collapsible Accordion Cards: "How your heart & sugar connect."

Card 1: Diabetes & Heart Disease (The link between high sugar and vessel damage).

Card 2: Hypertension & Sugar (Managing dual risks).

Card 3: Obesity & Insulin Resistance.

Card 4: Smoking & Vascular Risk.

AI Assistant: A floating chat-style bubble labeled "Educational AI" for follow-up questions.

Screen 5: Action & Referrals (The Next Step)

Recommendation Card: Specific advice based on the Screen 4 result.

Next Steps Checklist: Interactive list (e.g., "Schedule follow-up," "Clinic locator").

Primary CTA: "Find a Clinic Near You" (Blue).

Secondary CTA: "Download Results PDF" (Outline).

Footer: Permanent medical disclaimer in small, muted text.

3. UX Principles to Maintain

Single Task Focus: One primary action per screen to reduce cognitive load.

Friendly Microcopy: Use "We" and "Your" (e.g., "Let's look at your health together").

Low-Literacy Friendly: Use icons to support all text-based labels.
